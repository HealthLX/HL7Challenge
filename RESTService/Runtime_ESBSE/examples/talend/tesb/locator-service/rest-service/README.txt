Example for Locator REST Service

============================================
This example illustrates the usage of Locator REST Service methods.
 
 example of client that uses REST Service
 client/
 -first service endpoint is registered to Service Locator.
 -second service endpoint is registered to Service Locator.
 -third service endpoint is registered to Service Locator.
 -lookup for registered endpoints
 -lookup for random registered endpoint.
 -lookup for random registered endpoint.
 -lookup for random registered endpoint.
 -unregister first endpoint from Service locator.
 -unregister second endpoint from Service locator.
 -unregister third endpoint from Service locator.
 -lookup if the endpoints still registered.
 
 example of client that uses WebClient
 webclient/
 -register first endpoint for the service with systemTimeout=200
 -register second endpoint for the service with systemTimeout=400
 -lookup endpoints
 -lookup endpoint with systemTimeout=200
 -lookup endpoint with systemTimeout=400
 -unregister first endpoint
 -unregister second endpoint
 -lookup endpoint 
 
This example consists of the following components:

client/
	- This is a sample client application that uses the Locator REST Service to dynamically lookup/register/unregister service endpoints.

webclient/
	- This is a sample webclient application that uses the Locator REST Service to dynamically lookup/register/unregister service endpoints.

soapui/   
	- This directory contains soapUI project that allows for easily invoking methods of the Locator REST Service.
	
Prerequisite

Starting the Locator REST Service
---------------------------------------
   * Run a command in TESB container:  
feature:install tesb-locator-rest-service

Executing client application
---------------------------------------
   * From the command line:
cd client; mvn exec:java
In the console you will see the output of the example.

Executing webclient application
