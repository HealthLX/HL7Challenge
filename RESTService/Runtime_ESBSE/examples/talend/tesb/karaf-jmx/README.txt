Karaf-jmx Demo
==================================================

This sample demonstrates a client application whose resources 
can be monitored using JMX technology.  The client application uses
an MBean server connection by creating an MBean proxy, and then
accesses the Karaf MBean server.  This MBean proxy is local to the 
client, and emulates the remote Karaf MBean server.

This sample consists of 2 parts:

common/   - This directory contains the code that is common
            for clients you would like to create for remote management.

            This implementation allows you to:
            - connect to remote MBean server
            - create MBean proxies to access an MBean through a Java interface
            - add/remove repository to required instance of Karaf container
            - install/uninstall Karaf features in remote container
            - start/stop bundles in remote Karaf container
			
client/   - This is a sample client application that uses an
            implementation of the common project and demonstrates 
            all of the previously described operations


Usage
===============================================================================

Building the Demo
---------------------------------------
Using either Linux or Windows:

    From the example parent directories (i.e., Talend-ESB-<version>/examples/talend, Talend-ESB-<version>/examples/talend/tesb),
    run the following command to install the example parent pom files: talend-esb-examples-<version>.pom and talend-esb-examples-parent-<version>.pom into local maven repo.

    mvn install --non-recursive 

    From the base directory of this sample (i.e., where this README file is located), 
    the maven pom.xml file can be used to build and run the demo. 
  
    mvn clean install


Configure the Client
---------------------------------------
We expect that the remote MBean server is already running for TESB
and we are able connect to it. To do this we must define the settings
on client side Spring configuration (client-beans.xml):
 - JMX service URL (by default = "service:jmx:rmi://localhost:44444/jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/karaf-trun")
 - user (by default = "tadmin")
 - password (by default = "tadmin")

The above settings are already configured in the client-beans.xml and so will
work as-is if you started the default TESB container on localhost.


Running the Client
---------------------------------------
  * From the command line:
    cd client ; mvn exec:java
