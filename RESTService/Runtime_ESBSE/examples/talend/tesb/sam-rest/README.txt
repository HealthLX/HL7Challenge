Example for REST Service SAM enabled
============================================
This example illustrates the usage of SAM Feature for REST Service

This example consists of the following components:

service/
	- Order service which is registered with the SAM Feature after the starting.
	
common/   
	- This directory contains the code that is common to both the client and the Order server. 
	
client/
	- This is a sample client application that uses the SAM Feature.


Prerequisite
---------------------------------------
To build and run this example, you must install the J2SE Development Kit (JDK) 6.0 or above.

The SAM Server should be running.


Building the Demo
---------------------------------------
Using either Linux or Windows:

    From the example parent directories (i.e., Talend-ESB-<version>/examples/talend, Talend-ESB-<version>/examples/talend/tesb),
    run the following command to install the example parent pom files: talend-esb-examples-<version>.pom and talend-esb-examples-parent-<version>.pom into local maven repo.

    mvn install --non-recursive 

    From the base directory of this sample (i.e., where this README file is located), 
    the maven pom.xml file can be used to build and run the demo. 
  
    mvn install


Starting the Service
---------------------------------------
  * Add maven URL into karaf:
feature:repo-add mvn:org.talend.esb.examples.sam-rest/features/<version>/xml

  * Install example feature in container:
feature:install tesb-sam-rest


Running the Client
---------------------------------------
  * From the command line:
     cd client ; mvn exec:java

Note: please make sure the SAM Server already has been started (e.g. run tesb:start-sam) before you start the example Service/Client.
