JAX-RS JAX-WS Java First Example 
================================

The demo shows how a single service instance can be exposed as both JAX-RS and JAX-WS
services at the same time and how CXF JAX-RS and JAX-WS proxies can reuse the same code for
invoking on the corresponding endpoints.


Building the Demo
---------------------------------------

This sample consists of 3 parts:
common/   - This directory contains the code that is common
            for both the client and the server. 
            
service/  - This is where a HelloWorld service implementation shared by JAX-RS and JAX-WS endpoints is located

war/      - This module creates a WAR archive containing the code from common and service modules.   

client/   - This is a sample client application that shows how CXF JAX-RS and JAX-WS proxies are invoking on remote 
            JAX-RS and JAX-WS endpoints represented by HelloWorld interface 


Usage
===============================================================================
Note: Please follow the parent README.txt first for common build and container 
setup instructions.

Using either Linux or Windows:
    mvn install

Running this command will build the demo and create a WAR archive and an OSGi bundle 
for deploying the service either to servlet or OSGi containers.

Starting the service
---------------------------------------
* In the servlet container:

    cd war; mvn jetty:run

* From within the TESB OSGi container:
   karaf@trun> feature:install talend-cxf-example-jaxrs-jaxws-java-first

   (Make sure you've first installed the examples features repository as described in the
   parent README.)

Running the client
---------------------------------------

 * From the command line
   - cd client
   - mvn exec:java

By default, the client will use the http port 8080 for constructing the URIs.
This port value is set during the build in the client.properties resource file. 
If the server is listening on the alternative port then you can use an 'http.port' 
system property during the build:
   
- mvn install -Dhttp.port=8040

Demo Desciption
---------------

The goal of the demo is to show how the existing production code can be easily exposed as RESTful service by applying 
several JAX-RS annotations to the interfaces, for example, to the HelloWorld interface. 

Note how both JAX-WS and JAX-RS proxies reuse the same code procedures for consuming the services.

By following this approach users can experiment with the RESTful approach without necessarily changing the way the existing application
has been designed.
