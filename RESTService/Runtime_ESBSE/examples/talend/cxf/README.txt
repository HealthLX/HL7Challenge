Welcome to Talend examples for CXF
=========================================================

Industry leading open source Apache CXF implementation of JAX-WS to help 
you service enable your existing applications and interfaces.  The CXF 
lightweight, modular architecture is based on Spring, so it will work 
with your application regardless of the platform on which it is running. 
It will run on stand-alone JVM applications, as part of a servlet container 
such as Tomcat, within a JEE server, or in an OSGi container such as Equinox.  

This package contains several new examples that show advanced features
of CXF.  All of the examples are setup to be built and run independently,
but they are also all setup to be run in the Talend ESB OSGi container 
that can be obtained from:
http://www.talend.com/download.php#ESB

jaxws-cxf-sts: demonstrates having a SOAP client use CXF's stsclient 
to make a call to a Tomcat-hosted CXF Security Token Service (STS) and 
subsequently using the SAML token received to make a web service call to a CXF
web service provider.  Both standalone and OSGi-based clients are shown,
as well as standalone, Tomcat-based, and OSGi-based web service provider
options given.

jaxws-cxf-sts-advanced: More advanced version of the above showing OSGi
deployment of the STS, token providers, token validation, and WSP 
authorization based on attributes within the SAML token.

jaxws-ws-secpol: demonstrates using WS-SecurityPolicy and configuration 
to secure communication between CXF client and servers using various
security requirements and including tokens like UsernameToken and
SAML assertions.

jaxws-jms-spec: demonstrates using JAX-WS clients and servers to
talk SOAP over JMS, but using the SOAP/JMS Specification for 
configuration.

interceptors: demonstrates how a message changes and is manipulated
as it passes through the various CXF interceptors.

jaxrs-intro: shows basic features of the the JAX-RS 1.1 specification 
and API such as root resources, subresources and HTTP verbs (GET/PUT/POST).  

jaxrs-advanced:  building on the jaxrs-intro sample, this demo additionally
demonstrates multiple root resource classes, recursive subresources, 
resource methods consuming and producing data in different formats (XML 
and JSON), using JAX-RS Response to return status, headers and optional 
entity, using UriInfo and UriBuilder for working with URI and 
ExceptionMappers for handling application exceptions.

jaxrs-attachments:  demonstrates how JAX-RS consumers and providers can 
read and write multipart attachments.

jaxrs-jaxws-authorization: shows how a Role-Base-Access-Control policy 
can be applied to JAX-WS and JAX-RS services with the help of the 
container-managed authentication and CXF security filters enforcing 
the authorization rules.

jaxrs-jaxws-description-first: shows how SOAP services created as
part of the document (WSDL) first approach process can get RESTified by having
a CXF JAX-RS user model resource added which describes how an interface 
generated by the wsdl-to-java tool can be treated as the JAX-RS root resource.

jaxrs-jaxws-java-first: shows how a single service instance can be
exposed as both JAX-RS and JAX-WS services at the same time and how CXF 
JAX-RS and JAX-WS proxies can reuse the same code for invoking on the 
corresponding endpoints.

jaxrs-jms-http: demonstrates how a JAX-RS HTTP server can be enhanced
to receive JMS messages.

jaxrs-oath and jaxrs-oauth2: provides an examples of a REST application 
protected using OAuth / OAuth2 security.

jaxrs-transformations: demonstrates how CXF can help with maintaining
backward and forward compatibility between JAX-RS and JAX-WS consumers
and endpoints by using the Transformation Feature of CXF.

dev-guide-java-first and dev-guide-wsdl-first: sample applications
used as code walk-throughs in the Talend ESB Developers Guide 
(within the documentation set).

To build all examples:
===============================================================================

> cd examples
> mvn clean install

To prepare the TESB Container for the examples:
===============================================================================

Start TESB. From the TESB root directory:

> cd container
> bin/trun

In the TESB shell:

> feature:repo-add mvn:org.talend.cxf-examples/osgi/1.0/xml/features

This command adds the features repository for the examples to the container.  (See 
http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest-2.2.x/users-guide/provisioning.html for
more details.)  This only needs to be done once for all examples.

Note on Ports:

The CXF examples provided generally default to http port 8080, fine for standalone Tomcat
or embedded Jetty usage.  Talend ESB defaults out-of-the-box to port 8040, a value which
can be changed by editing the container/etc/org.ops4j.pax.web.cfg file.  Alternatively,
several of the examples provide a compile-time -Dhttp.port=xxxx option that can be used
to change the default HTTP port used by the sample.  See the individual READMEs for 
sample-specific information.
